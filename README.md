# Test - random chaos

## Description

You're asked to build a program which can generate visible or audible artwork based on random number. There is no limitation on the type of artwork, usually you are free to make things like a series of pictures, a piece of music or even chain-reaction animation. The generation algorithm is also up to you. We can't wait to see how you establish the relationship between number and visible or audible artwork.

## A simple example

> One candidate made a function to generate random number from 0 to 255. The function can map each *number* to a grayscale *color* - 0 for black and 255 for white.

Now your turn! But remember the above is just an example and copying it won't be a good idea for this test.

## Requirements

- For backend applicants: build a program with your preferred language to complete the test. Being able to make APIs which can be tested online will be a bonus.
- For frontend applicants: build a JavaScript program to complete the test. Being able to deploy a webapp on server will be a bonus.
- For iOS/Android applicants: build a mobile app with simple UI to complete the test. Being able to distribute the app online will be a bonus.
- You can use any libraries and frameworks to boost the development.
- When you finished, archive your project in .zip format and email it to us. Also a **README** to tell us how you designed and implemented this app is required.

## Expectations

- Think as a mathematician and artist first, then get hands dirty.
- Apply the most suitable technology to solve problems.
- Clear code structure and elegant style.
- Use git to track your work.
